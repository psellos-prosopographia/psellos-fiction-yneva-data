# Agent Roles

This repository supports multiple automated or human agent roles working with the data.

* **Data Entry**: introduces new entities and assertions with proper attribution.
* **Review**: checks consistency, provenance, and narrative layering.
* **Validation**: verifies schema conformance, rule regime scoping, and invariants.
