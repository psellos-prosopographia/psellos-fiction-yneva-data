# Agent Roles

This repository supports multiple automated or human agent roles working with the data.
This document defines operational roles only and confers no authority beyond that defined in GOVERNANCE.md.

* **Data Entry**: introduces new entities and assertions with proper attribution.
* **Review**: checks consistency, provenance, and narrative layering.
* **Validation**: verifies schema conformance, rule regime scoping, and invariants.

Governance and canonical paths follow the psellos-hub authority index:
