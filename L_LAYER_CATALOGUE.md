# L1 Layers

## L1.1 Sollerian
The official interpretation of history by the Church of the Sun.  
Metadata note: Compare with Roman Catholic official doctrine and perspective in real-life history; centralized, institutional, and norm-setting, without presuming propagandistic intent.

## L1.3 Gnielffen
Historical events as preserved and canonized through the Gnielffen tradition.  
Metadata note: Represents a de facto canonical perspective produced by a culturally and intellectually dominant polity within a wider Elven diaspora. Analogous to how much of what is labeled “Ancient Greek thought” is in practice Athenian, due to Athens’ literary, philosophical, and educational primacy. Compression of broader Elven plurality occurs in-world through Gnielffen dominance, not through out-of-world editorial smoothing.

## L1.4 Eulerian
History according to Eulerian Tradition.  
Metadata note: Competing and converging claims of a heterogeneous polity. Compare with the Holy Roman Empire in real-life history.

## L1.5 Godelian
History according to Godelian Tradition.  
Metadata note: Competing and converging claims of a relatively centralized polity. Compare with the 9th-century Byzantine Empire in real-life history.

# L2 Layers

## L2.1 Planetarian
Unofficial historiographical tradition shared by adherents to Universal Planetarianism.  
Metadata note: Not an institutional or canon-setting authority, but a shared interpretive posture operating within and against dominant L1 traditions. Compare with Protestant historiographical orientations relative to Catholic orthodoxy in real-life history.

# L4 Layers

## L4.4 Magocratic
The official “Historical Academic Canon” of the University of Arcane Studies.  
Metadata note: Self-conscious, reflexive historiography that explicitly synthesizes and critiques earlier narrative layers. Compare with modern Western academic historiography in real-life history.
