# Governance

Canonical governance policies live at repository root per the psellos-hub authority index. This file
defines the local governance constitution for this dataset and is subordinate to the psellos-hub
authority index.

## Authority and precedence

* The psellos-hub authority index is the external governance reference and prevails where it defines
  overlapping constraints.
* Local canonical policies in this repository are authoritative only when referenced in the
  authority index and stored in-repo.

## Scope

This governance applies to:

* canonical policies and specifications stored at repository root,
* dataset structure and canonical modeling assumptions,
* changes that affect rule regimes, vocabularies, or assertion semantics.

## Governance-tracked changes

The following changes require governance tracking in decision records:

* additions or changes to assertion semantics,
* additions or changes to vocabularies or rule regimes,
* structural changes to canonical data layout or policy boundaries.

## Procedural references

Decision procedures and templates are defined in [DECISIONS.md](DECISIONS.md).

## External reference

The psellos-hub authority index is the external governance reference:
