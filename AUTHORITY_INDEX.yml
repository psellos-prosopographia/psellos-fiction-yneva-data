interaction_scope: name: "External conversational design space" applies_to: "ChatGPT chat usage only" definition: > For the purposes of this project, an "External conversational design space" refers exclusively to an interactive ChatGPT chat used for ideation, analysis, drafting, critique, and non-binding design discussion that occurs outside the repository execution environment.
explicit_constraints: - "No direct filesystem access" - "No command execution capability" - "No ability to write, modify, or commit repository files" - "No persistent task state beyond the conversational session" exclusion_clause: > Any automated or semi-automated system capable of executing commands, writing files, applying diffs, committing changes, or maintaining multi-step task state (including but not limited to Codex-controlled task runners or CI-integrated agents) is explicitly excluded from this scope and MUST NOT treat itself as operating within the External conversational design space.
governance_note: > Outputs produced within this scope are advisory and exploratory only. They acquire authority only if later introduced into the repository through workflows defined in AI_WORKFLOW.md and recorded in accordance with DECISIONS/ and STATUS.md where applicable.
