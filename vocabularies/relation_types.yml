# Controlled vocabulary for relation/predicate terms.
# Semantic meaning is defined here; dataset assertions reference these ids.
terms:
  # Naming / designation
  - id: rel.designated_as
    label: designated as
    arity: value
    notes: >
      Canonical predicate for name/designation assertions. Use for persons, places,
      and (by convention) for names applied to historical occurrences, without
      minting event entities. See ONOMASTICS_POLICY.md and SPEC_ASSERTION_SHAPE.md.

  # Backward-compatible synonym (prefer rel.designated_as going forward)
  - id: rel.named_as
    label: named as
    arity: value
    notes: >
      Legacy naming predicate. Prefer rel.designated_as for new data; retained for
      compatibility with earlier assertions.

  # Characterization / classification
  - id: rel.characterized_as
    label: characterized as
    arity: value
    notes: Classification/characterization of an entity; often editorial/analytic.
